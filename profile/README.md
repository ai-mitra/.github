# Mitra-AI

## Why Mitra
"Mitra" means "friend" in Bengali. Our aim is to make a friendly assistant that can help generate high-quality code

## Objectives
1. Generate high-quality code (Only for Python, at the moment)
2. Helpful assistant for general-purpose question answering

## Dataset generation
We are following the approach laid out in the [Orca-2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11045.pdf) , as well as some augmentations to improve the reasoning capabilities for code
1. Generate test cases with reasoning for code snippets (Currently, it generates test cases based on operations and not types)
2.
